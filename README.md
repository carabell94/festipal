Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.

FestiPal is an app created with festival-goers in mind. It allows them to plan their experience in advance, and take away some of the initial stress that is always inevitable upon arrival.

This app was created by Cara Bell, Fernando Requeni Nacher, Lyubomir Dias and Shaun Lennon in the final 10 days of the Le Wagon London Bootcamp.
The app was built using Ruby on Rails, HTML5, CSS, Javascript ES6, Bootstrap, Cloudinary and was hosted on Heroku.
